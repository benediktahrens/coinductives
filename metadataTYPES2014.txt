#    starting with the backslash character).

We study the notions of relative comonad and comodule over a relative comonad.
We use these notions to give categorical semantics for the coinductive type families of streams and
 of infinite triangular matrices and their respective cosubstitution operations in intensional Martin-L\"of type theory.
Our results are mechanized in the proof assistant Coq.
