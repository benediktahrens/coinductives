	Abstract = {Rewriting is an essential tool for computer-based reasoning, both automated and assisted. 
It is so because rewriting is a general notion that permits to model a wide range of problems and 
provides means to effectively solve them. In a proof assistant, rewriting can be used to replace terms in 
arbitrary contexts, generalizing the usual equational reasoning to reasoning modulo arbitrary relations. 
This can be done provided the necessary proofs that functions appearing in goals are congruent with 
respect to specific relations. We present a new implementation of generalized rewriting in the Coq proof 
assistant, making essential use of the expressive power of dependent types and a recently implemented 
type class mechanism. The tactic improves on and generalizes previous versions by supporting natively 
higher-order functions, polymorphism and subrelations. The type class system inspired from Haskell 
provides a perfect interface between the user and such tactics, making them easily extensible.}}

This alternative to telescopes in particular allows multiple inheritance, maximal sharing of notations and theories, and automated structure inference. Our methodology is robust enough to support a hierarchy comprising a broad variety of algebraic structures, from types with a choice operator to algebraically closed fields. Interfaces for the structures enjoy the handiness of a classical setting, without requiring any axiom. Finally, we show how externally extensible some of these instances are by discussing a lemma seminal in defining the discrete logarithm, and a matrix decomposition problem.},

                  appendix with machine-checked proofs?
                  
                  We propose a concrete set of benchmarks for measuring
                  progress in this area. Based on the metatheory of System
                  F-sub, a typed lambda-calculus with second-order
                  polymorphism, subtyping, and records, these benchmarks
                  embody many aspects of programming languages that are
                  challenging to formalize: variable binding at both the term
                  and type levels, syntactic forms with variable numbers of
                  components (including binders), and proofs demanding
                  complex induction principles. We hope that these benchmarks
                  will help clarify the current state of the art, provide a
                  basis for comparing competing technologies, and motivate
                  further research.}

  (\emph{FM-sets}) can serve as the semantic basis of meta-logics for
  specifying and reasoning about formal systems involving name
  binding, $\alpha$-conversion, capture avoiding substitution, and so
  on.  We show that in FM-set theory one can express statements
  quantifying over `fresh' names and we use this to give a novel
  set-theoretic interpretation of name abstraction.  Inductively
  defined FM-sets involving this name-abstraction set former (together
  with cartesian product and disjoint union) can correctly encode
  object-level syntax modulo $\alpha$-conversion.  In this way, the
  standard theory of algebraic data types can be extended to encompass
  signatures involving binding operators.  In particular, there is an
  associated notion of structural recursion for defining
  syntax-manipulating functions (such as capture avoiding
  substitution, set of free variables, etc) and a notion of
  proof by structural induction, both of which remain pleasingly close
  to informal practice.}
