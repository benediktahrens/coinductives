\begin{definition}\label{def:poly_functor}
 Suppose $A : \Set$ is a type and $B: A \to \Set$ is a dependent type.
 We define a functor $F_{A,B} : \Setoid \to \Setoid$ as follows:
 the setoid $(X,R)$ is mapped to

 the setoid with carrier $\sum_{a:A}(B(a) \to X)$ and setoid relation
 %TODO
 
 A setoid morphism $f : (X,Rx) \to (Y,Ry)$ is mapped to 
 \[F_{A,B}(f) (t):= \langle \pi_1(t), \comp{\pi_2(t)}{f} \rangle \enspace . \]
%  TODO: show this is setoid morph
